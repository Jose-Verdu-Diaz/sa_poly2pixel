### File Naming Convention  ###
###############################

    File names follow the following structure:

        pppp-ssss_cccc.bmp

    - pppp:     MRI identificator
    - ssss:     Slice identificator
    - cccc:     Class (muscle) identificator

    Use the slice identificator to locate the error in the MRI stack

###############################

    ######### repeated_class ########

        We assume that only one instance of a class (muscle) can exist in a slice.
        When more than one instance of a class is found in a slice, the program 
        raises an error flag. 

        == False Positives ==
        Ocasionally, some pixels of the mask might be isolated from the rest.This 
        happens on fine detailed selections. The program is able to detect most 
        false positives, and marks them with the flag '[FALSE POSITIVE?]'.

    ######### incoherence_class ########

        We assume that the classes (muscles) are continous between slices. 
        For example, given 6 consecutive slices (a,b,c,d,e,f):

            - If a class is present in slices 'a,b,c,e' and 'f' then it should also 
              be in slice 'd'. If this is not the case, the program raises an error 
              and marks it with the '[MISSING]' flag.

            - If the slices 'a,b,c,e' and 'f' are empty, then slice 'd' should also 
              be. If this is not the case, the program raises an error and marks it 
              with the '[UNEXPECTED]' flag.

        == False Positives ==
        There are plenty of special cases where the program could raise a false 
        positive. The program is not cappable of recognising any of them, thus 
        making necessary some manual checking.

    ######### displacement_class ########

        We assume that classes (muscles) between slices are spatially continous.
        For example, assume we have a class 'C' present in 2 continous slices, 'a'
        and 'b'. The position of 'C' will be similar in both slices, then some of 
        the pixels of 'a' that are part of 'C' will remain in 'b':

                    a                                   b
            · · · · · · · · ·                   · · · · · · · · ·
            · · C C C C C · ·                   · · · C C C · · · 
            · C C C C C C C ·                   · · C C C C C · ·
            · C C C C C C C ·                   · · C C C C C · ·
            · C C C C C C · ·                   · · C C C C · · ·
            · C C C C C · · ·                   · · · C C · · · ·
            · · C C C · · · ·                   · · · · · · · · ·
            · · · · · · · · ·                   · · · · · · · · ·

        If less than 5% of the pixels are shared, the program raises an error.
        The error will be followed with the amount of shared pixels in the from
        '[x%]'.

        == False Positives ==

        The program will raise LOTS of false positives. The program is not 
        cappable of recognising any of them, thus making necessary some manual 
        checking.

        - Yellow:   Indicates the repeated muscles
        - Red:      Indicates the region that caused a (possible) false positive

    ######### incoherence_img ########
        
        (If there is an unexpected muscle)
        - Yellow:   Indicates an unexpected muscle

        (If there is a missing muscle)
        - Red:      Indicates the position of the muscle in the previous slice
        - Blue:     Indicates the position of the muscle in the next slice

    ######### displacement_img ########
        
        - Red:      Indicates the position of the muscle in the previous slice
        - Blue:     Indicates the position of the muscle in the current slice
        - Green:    Indicates the overlapping pixels of the muscles in the previous
                    and current slices

        Images also display the percentage of the current mask that overlaps with
        the last mask.
